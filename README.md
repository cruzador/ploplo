# Project description
The different groups you will constitute will have to submit a rough description of the semester project until November 5, 2019. This description has to summarize the project idea on 1 A4 page (Font = Times 12, single line interval)and absolutely has to contain the formulation of 1 or 2 working hypotheses your research will address(e.g. “Areas of the state of Geneva showing high vegetation indices favor physical activity and therefore the obesity rate in the corresponding hectares will be lowerthan in the hectareswhere the vegetation index is lower”).The project summary you will write has to be structured. 
  **1**.First, introduce a context for the problematicsyou identified. Shortly explain first what will be the object of your research, for example that you areinterested in studying thespatial distribution of individuals showing obesity and investigate a potential higher health risk for these persons when confronted to high temperatures (urban heat island phenomenon);
  **2**.Find 1 or 2 recent (published after 2015) scientific articles (not more at this stage) to mention in your description which results were obtained elsewhere in this domain and which methods theyused;
  **3**.Describe briefly the different datasets you think you will need to carry out your project; you do not need to describe them precisely, just mention what type of information you think you will need;
  **4**.Also describe the global approach you will use to implement your research (this element should be rather similar between groups);
  **5**.Formulate 1 or 2 working hypotheses you would try to verify or reject.In the successive weeks, you will be authorized to adjust the hypotheses, but you need this starting pointto initiate the reflection;
  **6**.Indicate at the end of your A4 page the full references to the 1-2 articles you used to get initial information on the topic (see point 2);
  **7**.Indicate to us how you think you willorganizethe work within the group(globallyhow will you distribute tasks and sharework, according to whicharguments/criteria?).
